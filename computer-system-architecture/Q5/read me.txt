Q5 says to ,
	identify the type of instruction based on opcode ..

working ::
the opcodes 1 to 6 are assigned to memory reference instructions ,,

problem arises in RR where they have common opcode i.e 7(111)
so, we solve this by making an instructions RR which in itself identifies the type of RR & executes it

we pass the format of RR instructions like 7800(Hex) as 2048(decimal)
then ,,  the micro-instruction 'RR'  identify the type of RR on basis of this address 
[ checks each bit & execute assigned operation (as per book ) ]

now , the I/O  instructions are to be handled inside the RR only ( but no space as 12 address bits have alrady been assigned to 12 RR instructions )
so .. we use the I bit as
when I==0 , it is  RR instructions ( identified by address bit)
when I==1 , it is MRI ( further , the type of MRI is identified by address bits )  
Note :
we modify the fetch routine necessarily ,, to  remove the handling of 'I' bit inside it 
as 'I' bit we are using for I/O , so that can cause clashing -- serious clashing
